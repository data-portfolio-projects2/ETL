## **Running the Automation**

To run the automation process, execute the script from the Command Prompt (CMD), as there might be issues running the script from VS Code on your system:

1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD) window.
2. Navigate to the folder containing your scripts:
```bash
   cd C:\Users\loydt\Documents\data_automation
```
3. Run the automation script:
```bash
   python data_automation_process.py
