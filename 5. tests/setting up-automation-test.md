### **Process Flow:**

1. Kaggle: The Kaggle dataset is accessed using the Kaggle API. The dataset file is downloaded to the GitHub Actions environment (not to GitHub directly).
2. GitHub (Python ETL Script): The ETL script in your GitHub repository contains functions to:
  - Download the dataset from Kaggle.
  - Preprocess the data as needed (e.g., cleaning, transformations).
3. BigQuery: After preprocessing the data, the script uploads the processed data directly into Google BigQuery using the BigQuery Python client or command-line tools.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. Set Up GitHub Repository:
- Your ETL script, written in Python (or other language), should be stored in a GitHub repository.
- The repository will contain a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of downloading the Kaggle dataset, preprocessing it, and uploading it to BigQuery.

2. GitHub Actions Workflow:

- The GitHub Actions workflow is set up to run on a schedule or when triggered (e.g., a push to the main branch).
- The workflow will include steps for installing dependencies (like kaggle API, google-cloud-bigquery), running the Python script, and uploading the processed data to BigQuery.

3. Download Dataset from Kaggle:

- Kaggle API: Use the Kaggle API in your Python script to download datasets. You will need to authenticate with your Kaggle API key, which can be stored securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Example of downloading from Kaggle using Python:

```python
from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi

api = KaggleApi()
api.authenticate()
api.dataset_download_files('dataset-owner/dataset-name', path='/tmp', unzip=True)
```

4. Preprocess the Data:

- After downloading the dataset, your Python script will preprocess the data (e.g., remove null values, change formats, filter rows, etc.) using libraries like pandas or numpy.

5. Upload Data to BigQuery:

- Once the data is preprocessed, the script will upload the data to Google BigQuery. You can use the BigQuery Python client to upload the file directly to BigQuery.

- Example of uploading data to BigQuery:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/tmp/processed_data.csv')

# Set up BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Upload to BigQuery
dataset_id = 'your-project.your_dataset'
table_id = f"{dataset_id}.your_table"
job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(df, table_id)
job.result()  # Wait for the load to complete
```
6. GitHub Actions Workflow Example (etl.yml): Here's an example GitHub Actions YAML file (.github/workflows/etl.yml) that automates the process:

```python
name: ETL Automation for Kaggle to BigQuery

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs daily at midnight UTC
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Runs on push to the main branch

jobs:
  run-etl:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install kaggle google-cloud-bigquery pandas

      - name: Set Kaggle API Credentials
        run: echo "${{ secrets.KAGGLE_API_KEY }}" > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
        # Assuming you've stored your Kaggle API key in GitHub Secrets

      - name: Download Dataset from Kaggle
        run: |
          python download_data.py
          # Python script that downloads the dataset using the Kaggle API

      - name: Preprocess Data
        run: |
          python preprocess_data.py
          # Python script that preprocesses the downloaded data

      - name: Upload Processed Data to BigQuery
        run: |
          python upload_to_bigquery.py
          # Python script that uploads the preprocessed data to BigQuery
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Points to Consider:**

- Kaggle API Key: Store your Kaggle API key securely in GitHub Secrets to authenticate and access datasets.
- Preprocessing: Your ETL script will preprocess the data before uploading it to BigQuery. Ensure your data transformations are done efficiently using libraries like pandas.
- BigQuery Client: Use the Google Cloud Python Client to load data into BigQuery directly from the GitHub Actions runner. You'll need to set up Google Cloud credentials (stored in GitHub Secrets) for authentication.

**Advantages of This Approach:**

1. Fully Automated: The entire process (download, preprocess, and load to BigQuery) can be automated using GitHub Actions, so it runs automatically without needing your local machine.
2. Cloud-Based: Since everything runs on GitHub Actions, you wonâ€™t need to use your local machine, and all the resources can be cloud-based (Kaggle, BigQuery, etc.).
3. Scalable: You can scale this approach to handle multiple datasets or workflows by adjusting your GitHub Actions workflow.

**Limitations to Consider:**
- Execution Time: GitHub Actions has a limit on job runtime (typically 6 hours per job for free-tier users), so if your dataset is very large or preprocessing is time-consuming, you may need to optimize or break the task into smaller jobs.
- Storage: GitHub itself is not ideal for storing large datasets. As mentioned, you'll store the files either in Google Cloud Storage or upload them directly to BigQuery.
- API Limitations: Be aware of any API rate limits for Kaggle and Google Cloud that may affect your workflow.
