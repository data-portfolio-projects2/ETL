### **Process Flow:**

1. Kaggle: The Kaggle dataset is accessed using the Kaggle API. The dataset file is downloaded to the GitHub Actions environment (not to GitHub directly).
2. GitHub (Python ETL Script): The ETL script in your GitHub repository contains functions to:
- Download the dataset from Kaggle.
- Preprocess the data as needed (e.g., cleaning, transformations).
3. BigQuery: After preprocessing the data, the script uploads the processed data directly into Google BigQuery using the BigQuery Python client or command-line tools.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. Set Up GitHub Repository:
- Your ETL script, written in Python (or other language), should be stored in a GitHub repository.
- The repository will contain a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of downloading the Kaggle dataset, preprocessing it, and uploading it to BigQuery.

2. GitHub Actions Workflow:

- The GitHub Actions workflow is set up to run on a schedule or when triggered (e.g., a push to the main branch).
- The workflow will include steps for installing dependencies (like kaggle API, google-cloud-bigquery), running the Python script, and uploading the processed data to BigQuery.

3. Download Dataset from Kaggle:

- Kaggle API: Use the Kaggle API in your Python script to download datasets. You will need to authenticate with your Kaggle API key, which can be stored securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Example of downloading from Kaggle using Python:

```python
from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi

api = KaggleApi()
api.authenticate()
api.dataset_download_files('dataset-owner/dataset-name', path='/tmp', unzip=True)
```
